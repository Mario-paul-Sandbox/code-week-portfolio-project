Monday

AM

3pm - 5pm: Devs :  Code wireframe/low fi & hamburger menu >>> Mobile First!  
5pm-6pm: Both start wrapping up for the day
 

Daily Deliverables: Low-fidelity (Mobile + Desktop) and Mobile Menu done today

The entire process is a collaboration. The designers should be helping on the coding side and the developers should be helping on the design side.  Both parties should be contributing; this is a group effort.  Remember camera’s on! 

Low-fi strategy for Mobile and Desktop can look very simple .. can be hand drawn.. just focusing on a rough outline of each section that will go into the page - breaking down the content overview and goals for users for each section.
